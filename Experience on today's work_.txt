Experience on Assignments:

DAY-1:

Bank Account:

As we already learned python object-oriented programming concepts in the first year, it is easy to write the code for today's assignment. The sequence of steps given in the assignment helped me solve the problem quickly and made it easier.  This assignment and today's concepts helped me brush up on all the python and object-oriented programming concepts.



DAY-2:

The instructions were clear on how to procede further and I came to know how to create a branch as well merging the code into the master branch it helped me. In problem I had displayed the ordered list and few required values.  This assignment  helped me to brush up all the concepts in python again as well as OOPs concepts also.
